  p Unless otherwise stated, all fees are quoted in United States Dollars.  If your payment method fails or your account is past due, we may collect fees owed using other collection mechanisms.  (This includes charging other payment methods on file with us, retaining collection agencies and legal counsel, and for accounts over 180 days past due, deducting the amount owed from your PayPal account balance.)

    strong You and FUSE, SPC each agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and FUSE, SPC shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify.

    li
      p: strong Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief
      p: strong YOU AND FUSE, SPC AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS PART OF ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING.  UNLESS BOTH YOU AND FUSE, SPC AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S OR PARTY'S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING.  ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S).  ANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT AFFECT OTHER FUSE, SPC USERS. 
    li
      p: strong Arbitration Procedures
      p Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.  Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited.  However, an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual.  An arbitrator also must follow the terms of this User Agreement as a court would.
      p The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under its rules and procedures, including the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (as applicable), as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate.  The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org.  A form for initiating arbitration proceedings is available on the AAA's website at http://www.adr.org. 
      p The arbitration shall be held in the county in which you reside or at another mutually agreed location.  If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, you or FUSE, SPC may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions, which election shall be binding on you and FUSE, SPC subject to the arbitrator's discretion to require an in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant.  Attendance at an in-person hearing may be made by telephone by you and/or FUSE, SPC, unless the arbitrator requires otherwise.  
      p The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with the laws of the State of Washington, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law.  The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different FUSE, SPC users, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same FUSE, SPC user to the extent required by applicable law.  The arbitrator's award shall be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
    li
      p: strong Severability
      p With the exception of any of the provisions of this Agreement to Arbitrate ("Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief"), if a court decides that any part of this Agreement to Arbitrate is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this Agreement to Arbitrate shall still apply. If a court decides that any of the provisions of this Agreement to Arbitrate ("Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief") is invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Agreement to Arbitrate shall be null and void.  The remainder of the User Agreement and its Legal Disputes Section will continue to apply.
    li
      p: strong Future Changes to the Agreement to Arbitrate
      p Notwithstanding any provision in the User Agreement to the contrary, you and we agree that if we make any change to this Agreement to Arbitrate (other than a change to any notice address or website link provided herein) in the future, that change shall not apply to any claim of which you provided FUSE, SPC with written notice prior to the effective date of the change.  
  h3 C. Judicial Forum for Legal Disputes
  p Unless you and we agree otherwise, in the event that the Agreement to Arbitrate above is found not to apply to you or to a particular claim or dispute, either as a result of your decision to opt-out of the Agreement to Arbitrate or a court order, you agree that any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise between you and FUSE, SPC must be resolved exclusively by a state or federal court located in Benton-Franklin County, Washington.  You and FUSE, SPC agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Benton-Franklin County, Washington for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes.
